## 📊 Interactive Simulations Explained

### **Simulator Logic**
- **Siloed Approach**: Each dept optimizes independently
  - Lower NPV ($245M)
  - Poor recovery (78%)
  - Higher costs ($125M)
  - More risks (8 events)

- **Integrated Approach**: Collaborative optimization
  - Higher NPV ($385M) - **+57% improvement**
  - Better recovery (92%) - **+18% improvement**
  - Lower costs ($98M) - **-22% reduction**
  - Fewer risks (2 events) - **-75% reduction**

### **Calculator Logic**
- Demonstrates value chain thinking
- Shows how spending more on blasting improves overall profit
- Siloed: Minimize blasting cost → poor fragmentation → low recovery
- Integrated: Optimize total system → better fragmentation → high recovery → more profit
